## About the Project

The Pig Dice Game is a classic two-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a fun and strategic game where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points, but they must be careful not to roll a 1!

## How to Play

### Game Rules:

1. **Two players** take turns rolling a single dice
2. On each turn, a player can roll the dice multiple times to accumulate points in their **current score**
3. If a player rolls a **1**, they lose all their current score points and their turn ends
4. A player can choose to **"Hold"** their current score, which adds it to their total score and ends their turn
5. The **first player to reach 100 points wins** the game!

### Game Controls:

- **ðŸŽ² Roll Dice**: Roll the dice to add points to your current score
- **ðŸ“¥ Hold**: Add your current score to your total score and end your turn
- **ðŸ”„ New Game**: Reset the game and start over

## Strategy Tips:

- **Risk vs Reward**: The more you roll, the more points you can accumulate, but you risk rolling a 1
- **When to Hold**: Consider holding when you have a decent current score to secure points
- **Watch Your Opponent**: If your opponent is close to winning, you might need to take more risks

## Technical Features:

- **Responsive Design**: Clean and modern UI that works on different screen sizes
- **Dynamic Dice Images**: Visual dice representation with images for numbers 1-6
- **Game State Management**: Proper handling of player turns, scores, and win conditions
- **Interactive Feedback**: Visual indicators for active player and winner
